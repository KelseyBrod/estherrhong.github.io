<!-- Really great use of negative space, font size, text placement, build of narrative in the body and footer, and clever looping! Made me laugh and send to some friends, because it really captures the art major in a research school experience!
timely submission: 28/30
technical skills: 30/30 (nice challenges with pseudo class)
creativity, concept, craft: 30/30
attendance/participation: 8/10 (You are great at participating in class, although I think missing two courses during this slowed you down! thanks for working so hard to get it in)
96/100, great job!!
